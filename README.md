# üîç Project Overview
Implemented and tested a UART communication system on an FPGA using Verilog, incorporating custom modifications to existing modules. Developed the FPGA design with Quartus Lite and integrated a Raspberry Pi for data input.

## üîß Key Responsibilities
- Initial Review and Selection: Evaluated existing Verilog RTL for UART transceivers and selected an appropriate design for adaptation.
- Module Customization: Adapted UART transmitter and receiver modules to meet specific project requirements, ensuring compatibility with the FPGA architecture.
- System Integration: Connected the UART system with a Raspberry Pi to achieve smooth data transmission.
- Testbench Creation: Developed a detailed Verilog testbench to simulate and verify the performance of the UART modules under various scenarios.
- Operational Verification: Performed extensive simulations to validate UART functionality, covering edge cases.
- FPGA Implementation: Synthesized, placed, routed, and programmed the design onto the FPGA, verifying it with real-world data transmission.
